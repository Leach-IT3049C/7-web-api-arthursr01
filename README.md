## Use Cases (How to test)

* Which Web API did you use, and where is it being used in the application?
I used the video and audio apis in this program. It is being used in the body of the program
* What are application use cases?
The use case for the program is you can use it to test your microphone and your camera. Obviously, it shows your facecam but it also outputs your audio, just hit the button to begin capturing
## Technical Write-up of selection of Web API selected:
The web API I used in this program is the media capture that connects to your webcam and displays the capture on the website, along with outputing the audio into your devices speakers. Few limitations with the API is that when programming you need to identify the audio and video separately. Also, by itself you can't really start or stop the capture, you'd have to use either a dbutton or on load to even get it to start.
## Self Reflection(s):
Overall this was rather easy it was just the process of implimenting the code and getting it to work. I also to change it up used a button rather than the on load which I had it previously.
## How long it took me/us to finish this:
4 hours.
